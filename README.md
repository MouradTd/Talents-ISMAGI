# Talent_Ismagi








## Name
Talents ISMAGI

## Description
Our platform is designed to identify talent in real-time, helping organizations accelerate their hiring processes by connecting potential candidates to projects that match their skill sets, making the recruitment and hiring process more efficient.

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.



## Support
